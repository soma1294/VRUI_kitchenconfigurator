# Setup
Unity Version: 2019.2.8f1 or higher, but lower then version 2019.3.

Clone the rep and add it in the unity hub. It should work out of the box.

If there are errors, here are the used packages/plugins:
- Oculus Integration ([How to Setup Unity to develop for Oculus Quest](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/book-unity-gsg/))
- TMPro

# Controls with TouchController
- Press X on the left controller or A on the right controller to teleport.
- Use the Handtriggers to grab the kitchen elements
- Stretch your index finger (do not touch the index trigger) to interact with the buttons.
- The white ball next to the UI can be grabbed to move the UI arround freely

# Controls with Handtracking
- Do this gesture to activate the teleport arc...

- ... then pinch with both hands to teleport to the loaction you're targeting. The target can be moved by looking around.
- Make a fist while touching the kitchen element to grab it
- Stretch your index finger to interact with the buttons
- The white ball next to the UI can be grabbed to move the UI arround freely

**Grabbing in handtrack mode is still very unreliable, controller mode is recommended**
