# Setup
Unity Version: 2019.2.8f1 or higher, but lower then version 2019.3.

Clone the rep and add it in the unity hub. It should work out of the box.

**Handtracking is not yet implemented**

If there are errors, here are the used packages/plugins:
- Oculus Integration
- TMPro

# Controls
- Press X on the left controller or A on the right controller to teleport.
- Use the Handtriggers to grab the kitchen elements
- Stretch your index finger (do not touch the index trigger) to interact with the buttons.
- The white ball next to the UI can be grabbed to move the UI arround freely
